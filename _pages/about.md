About me
======
I am an about to graduate PhD student from [the Robotics Institute](https://www.uts.edu.au/research/robotics-institute), School of Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering, University of Technology Sydney. My principal supervisor is [A/Prof. Teresa Vidal-Calleja](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Teresa.VidalCalleja) and co-supervisor is [Dr. Alen Alempijevic](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/alen.alempijevic). My thesis is entitled ``Probabilistic Implicit Surfaces for Localisation, Mapping and Planning". My research focus is on probabilistic perception with depth sensors to perform efficient and effective mapping, accurate localisation and optimisation-based path planning for robotic systems. Please find my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X0TZjD-LzmnslNrNC6BWWqwjPeGUFBrt/view?usp=sharing) here.
