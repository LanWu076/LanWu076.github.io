About me
======
I am an incoming Lecturer in Robotics at the University of Western Australia (starting February 2026). I received my PhD degree in robotics in 2023 from the Robotics Institute (RI) at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), where I was supervised by [Prof. Teresa Vidal-Calleja](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Teresa.VidalCalleja) and [A/Prof. Alen Alempijevic](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/alen.alempijevic). Since completing my PhD, I have been working as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the UTS Robotics Institute.

My research focuses on robotic perception, 3D scene understanding and reconstruction, SLAM and mapping, dynamic environment modelling, active perception, and robot manipulation and planning. I also work with alternative and multi-modal sensing, including LiDAR, RGB-D, sonar and millimetre-wave radar. A central theme in my work is the use of probabilistic and field-based representations to enable robust perception, mapping and control in complex, dynamic environments. Applications span advanced manufacturing, field robotics, human–robot collaboration, and assistive technologies such as bionic visual–spatial devices for people who are blind or vision-impaired.

- 1 paper in *IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO)*  as first author
- 6 papers in *IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)*
- Multiple publications at *ICRA* and *IROS*
- In 2024, I was recognised as an **RSS Pioneer**, a distinction awarded to 30 early-career robotics researchers worldwide
- I serve as a reviewer for T-RO, RA-L, JFR, ICRA and IROS
- I serve as Associate Editor for **ICRA 2025 and 2026** in the Localisation and Mapping session

Robotic Projects I Have Contributed To (2020–2025)
======
* **Surface Reconstruction for the Meat and Livestock Project** <br />
I applied my research outcomes in the meat and livestock project for trait estimation, funded by the Australian Government Department of Agriculture&Water Resources as part of its Rural R&D for Profit programme, Meat and Livestock Australia under the Grant V.RDP.2005. By using the probabilistic mapping approaches developed during my PhD, my main objective was to convert and process noisy and incomplete point clouds and depth images of non-rigid livestock and rigid carcass into 3D meshes for further processing.

* **Multi-sensor Perception, Calibration and Synchronisation for a Fast Off-road Vehicle** <br />
I also contributed to UTS' next generation of fast-wheeled robots. During my studies, UTS built FORV, a Fast Off-Road Vehicle for Defence Applications and I was responsible for establishing the multi-sensor fusion platform for mapping and navigation. Calibrating and working across several visual sensors including a binocular camera, a 3D LiDAR and an inertial measurement unit, we managed to have a data collection and synchronisation system based on NVIDIA Jetson and ROS.

* **Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping for Locomotive No.1** <br />
I had a precious opportunity to work with my colleagues to measure the digital representation of the historical train [Locomotive No. 1](https://www.maas.museum/event/locomotive-no-1/) in the [Powerhouse Museum](https://www.maas.museum/powerhouse-museum/). The datasets were collected by LiDAR sensor and RGB-D camera along with an IMU sensor. We operated the sensors around the train to have high-quality observations and then utilise various SLAM frameworks to produce an accurate surface of the train. Moreover, I generated the colored point cloud of the full train using RGB information for LiDAR measurements.
